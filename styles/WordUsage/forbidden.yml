The use of *TCP/IP network* can lead people to believe that the network is connection-oriented because TCP is a connection-oriented protocol; actually, the network has the characteristics of IP. it is connectionless. However, almost every vendor&rsquo;s product that allows users to connect with this network has *TCP/IP* in the product name. Thus, the use of *TCP/IP network* is common despite its inaccuracy."
