  - 24/7: "Do not use this abbreviation to indicate high availability, nonstop operation or support, such as for database and e-commerce applications or monitoring.  Do not use to indicate the general availability of something, such as service. If you must use an abbreviation, use *24x7* instead.  *24x7* is acceptable usage, provided that you are consistent within a document or library. However, if possible, use descriptive wording instead.  Whenever possible, use descriptive wording, for example, *High-availability databases not only are universally available but also have high reliability and serviceability” or *Operations are monitored 24 hours a day, every day of the week.”"

Saying *congratulations* can sound patronizing to native English speakers, and can create problems for translators."
  - contextual help: "Do not use to describe how to use the help. Use *help* when you are addressing users of help. Use *context-sensitive help* when you are describing how to create different types of help information.  Do not use in customer information to describe how to use the help. Instead, describe the help in terms of how the user accesses it. If you are describing how to create different types of help information, use *context-sensitive help*."

  - sweet spot: "Do not use in technical information or in marketing content. It does not describe any specific technical operation or task, nor does it offer any insight into why a client should purchase an IBM solution.  Do not use this term to describe the ideal placement of an IBM solution. This usage dilutes the value of the IBM message by sounding like jargon or marketing-speak. Also, because of the colloquial nature of the term, *sweet spot* could be difficult to translate."
  - totem pole: "Do not use in reference to terms such as *low man on the totem pole* or *bottom of the totem pole*.
