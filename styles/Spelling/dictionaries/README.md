# Dictionaries

You can add common words to the dictionary to have them ignored in your results.

## Adding terms to the dictionary

1. Add a term to the `.dic` file.
2. Optional: Include common prefixes or suffixes for the root word as part of the same entry. Use the `.aff` file as a key. For example, `/M` is suffix for `'s`, `/S` is the suffix for `s`, `es`, and `ies`, and `/MS` is the combination of `/M` and `/S`. 
Example:
The entry `abide/JGSR` includes these words as part of the dictionary: `abide`, `abidings`, `abiding`, `abides`, and `abider`
