I’d like to take this opportunity to welcome you to the Open Liberty project, an open source runtime for Java microservices. 

smthing wrng!!

In 2012, IBM released WebSphere Liberty, an application server designed for the cloud. It was small, lightweight, and designed with modern application development in mind. It wasn’t perfect, it didn’t have everything people wanted, but it was a great start. Since then we have expanded Liberty to make it fully Java EE 7 certified, and we have deployed it to every major developer platform, including Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry. Liberty has been deployed successfully at a large number of our customers and continues to be rolled out. However, in this industry nothing stays still and the bar is constantly moving.
